We'll be adding the host in the known hosts file so we can 
ssh the first time via pass

[ansible:server]
ssh-keyscan -H 172.35.0.11 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh-keyscan -H 172.35.0.12 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh-keyscan -H 172.35.0.13 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
ssh-keyscan -H 172.35.0.14 >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
